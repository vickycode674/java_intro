java bro...fav

Java is one of the most important and belonging to the core part of programming


-->so java well planned and covered with a parts like java virtual machine and java runtime Enviroment on top of os
  
                                            (jdk->jre->jvm)

-->jvm+libraries=jre

-->java is wora ->write once read anywhere

procdure of java functioning-:

step 1)User writes a java codes using.java a and then javac compiles to bit format

step2.) byt code is class file format this files is taken towards jre  and then jre -> os 

step 3.)all things are interelated

step 4.)every year java might changes but its base remains same through the 10years...

Software is process to solve the problem and find solution

-->In this world every problem is solved using virtual world (software) -->amazon,uber,bms etc,banking
 
 -->while solving and analzying the most important element is data(it is received and created and stored0

features-:

Java is strongly typed language. This means in order to use a variable it must be declared with its type. The variables once declared of some type cannot be changed to other type but its value can be changed to other value of same type.


                                          RUNTIME VS COMPILE TIME

Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to the machine code (i.e. binary code). Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.


*Dataypes characterisitics:	

-->char takes 2bytes in java (bigger range than other languages) by default double is taken

-->byte is in range of -128 to 127

-->for float and long we have to specify with their appearance in java compiler
